1) 3
    EXPLANATION: Modulo (%) gives us the remainder of the division. 
    27 divided by 6 is 4 with remainder 3. So the answer is 3.

2) 7.5
    EXPLANATION: Arithmetic follows the order of operations. 
    Division has a higher precedence than addition. 
    5 + 5 / 2.0 -> 5 + 2.5 -> 7.5

3) 3
    EXPLANATION: Division with integers will ignore the decimal part of the result. 
    If we want to get a decimal one of the numbers must be a decimal. 
    For example, 10 / 3.0 will give 3.33333
